##Submission 1 - Define workflow schedule for accessioning
`As a:` digital archivist

`I want to:` be able to create a multi-stage workflow that different individuals can access at defined points

`So that:` Records creators with a mandate to deposit university records, or the archivist, can initiate a records deposit, records creators or the archivist can add records and metadata, and the archivist can review before final ingest

`Done looks like:` I have a mediated workflow in which records creators can easily deposit records and the archivist can monitor and approve the process

##Submission 2 - Support for web archiving
`As a:` repository user

`I want to:` nominate a URL for a webpage that has historical significance

`So that:` a digital archivist can review the nomination to determine if it fits the criteria for further ingest into web archiving activities

`Done looks like:` If my nomination is selected for further web archiving, I can return to the repository to see the archived version of the web page
