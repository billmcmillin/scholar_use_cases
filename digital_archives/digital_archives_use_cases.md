##Submission 1 - Define workflow schedule for accessioning
`As a:` digital archivist

`I want to:` be able to create a multi-stage workflow that different individuals can access at defined points

`So that:` Records creators with a mandate to deposit university records, or the archivist, can initiate a records deposit, records creators or the archivist can add records and metadata, and the archivist can review before final ingest

`Done looks like:` I have a mediated workflow in which records creators can easily deposit records and the archivist can monitor and approve the process
