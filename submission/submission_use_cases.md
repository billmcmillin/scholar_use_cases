## Submission 1
`As a:` repository submitter

`I want:` my graduate student proxy submitter to be able to fill out certain fields and other fields to be left blank so I can fill them in. The submission is held in a queue until I can review it

`So that:` I can ensure certain fields are managed by me

`Done looks like:` When I log in I can see the documents waiting my input with the blank fields I need to fill out
