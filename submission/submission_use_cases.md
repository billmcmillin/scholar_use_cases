## Submission 1 - Proxy Submission
``As a:`` repository submitter

``I want:`` my graduate student proxy submitter to be able to fill out certain fields and other fields to be left blank so I can fill them in. The submission is held in a queue until I can review it

``So that:`` I can ensure certain fields are managed by me

``Done looks like:`` When I log in I can see the documents waiting my input with the blank fields I need to fill out

##Submission 2 - Defining authorship
`As an:` archivist

``I want:`` it to be clear that a work I am submitting is not necessarily created by me by being able to suppress contributor in the public image, or otherwise make it clear this is an archival submission

``So that:`` it is clear who the original publisher/creator is

``Done looks like:`` Those viewing the record understand who the actual creator/office of origin is

##Submission 3 - Mediated submission through customized page
`As a:` university records manager

`I want:` university staff members to be able to submit things through a designated page for university records by using their 6+2 and without having to sign up for a DR account. This would preferably be done through a single page on the ARB website as a portal for depositing electronic university records

`So that:` submission of university records is more consistent and easier, but university staff submitters do not have control of submissions beyond the initial upload process

`Done looks like:`I (the records manager) can send this link to those needing to deposit electronic records to the DR

##Submission 4 - Mediated submission

`As a:` university records manager

`I want:` to be able to review and approve for public display the university records submitted by university staff members

`So that:` submission of university records is mediated

`Done looks like:` I (the records manager) can look in my queue and see what is waiting my approval and approve it

##Submission 5 - Mediated submission

`As a:` submitter to the repository

`I want:`to be able to create “submission templates” that always pre-populate certain fields with boilerplate text of my choosing

`So that:` I can ensure metadata consistency when I am working on large projects with the same provenance/characteristics

`Done looks like:` When I am uploading, I can choose a submission template I have created that auto-fills certain fields with the metadata I have specified

##Submission 6 - Batch submission
`As a:` visual resources librarian/user/archivist

`I want to:` add a work record (metadata) without adding a digital file

`So that:` I can add a work record to multiple items at a time and add specific information per item later.

`Done looks like:` multiple works have the same metadata.

##Submission 7 - Batch submission
`As a:` visual resources librarian/user/archivist

`I want to:` view a submitted batch and view individual records and assign metadata to records I select from one to many

`So that:` I can add metadata to multiple records at a time.

`Done looks like:` Batch items appear as a list with a check box to add work record

##Submission 8 - Batch submission of large sets of records
`As a:` archivist

`I want to:` submit large groups of different records at once

`So that:` I can minimize the number of submissions I have to process

`Done looks like:` I can submit multiple records at one time and know they have been successfully placed in the repository

##Submission 9 - Granular levels of authorization for submissions to specific collections, based on credentials 
`As a:` collection manager

`I want to:` delegate specific permissions to certain individuals to be able to submit items to some parts of my collection, but not others

`So that:` those individuals can login and upload things only where I've given permission

`Done looks like:` Individuals can login and submit items to certain areas and I can grant these granular permissions 

##Submission 10 - Granular levels of authorization for administrative functions of existing records in specific collections, based on credentials 
`As a:` collection manager

`I want to:` delegate permission to certain individuals to be able to manage/edit items and metadata for records already in a collection

`So that:` those individuals can login and edit things only where I've given permission

`Done looks like:` Individuals can login and manage items within certain areas, without access to other areas, and I can grant these granular permissions
