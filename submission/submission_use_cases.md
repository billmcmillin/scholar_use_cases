## Submission 1
`As a:` repository submitter

`I want:` my graduate student proxy submitter to be able to fill out certain fields and other fields to be left blank so I can fill them in. The submission is held in a queue until I can review it

`So that:` I can ensure certain fields are managed by me

`Done looks like:` When I log in I can see the documents waiting my input with the blank fields I need to fill out

##Submission 2
`As an:` archivist

`I want:` it to be clear that a work I am submitting is not necessarily created by me by being able to suppress contributor in the public image, or otherwise make it clear this is an archival submission

`So that:` it is clear who the original publisher/creator is

`Done looks like:` Those viewing the record understand who the actual creator/office of origin is
