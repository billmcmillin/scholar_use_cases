## Submission 1 - Keyword in context (KWIC) view of full-text search results
`As a:` user of the repository

`I want to:` do a keyword search for items that match my query and know where in the item that word appears

`So that:` the search results show the contextual placement of the word within the item or its metadata

`Done looks like:` I get a results list of items with a notation of where the keyword appears
	
## Submission 2 - Machine-readable text searching (full text)
`As a:` repository user

`I want to:` search the text of objects within the repository

`So that:` if my search term is contained within the text of an object within the repository, the result will be included in the set of relevant results

`Done looks like:` when I do a search, the result set includes all objects where the search term is included within the text of an object

## Submission 3 - Discoverable through OAI harvest (or other recognized standard) for integration with external systems such as discovery layers
`As a:` metadata professional

`I want to:` get standardized and appropriate information about what is available from the repository

`So that:` I can store that information for my own use or replicate it elsewhere

`Done look like:` I go to a URL and enter parameters to define appropriateness, and I receive a standardized machine-readable response with the information

## Submission 4 - Search based on metadata (author, title, subject, series, date, etc.) or facet
`As a:` repository user

`I want to:` perform searches on specified metadata fields

`So that:` I can limit the scope of my search to a single metadata field

`Done looks like:` the user interface includes a mechanism for selecting a field and performing a search on the content of just that field, and the results of the search only include results where the specified field of each record contains a relevant term

## Submission 5 - Search based on metadata (author, title, subject, series, date, etc.) or facet
`As a:` repository user

`I want to:` limit my search by a particular facet

`So that:` I can limit an existing search to include only results with a specified, existing heading

`Done looks like:` the user interface includes a list of the contents for a field, and a mechanism for selecting that field/content combination, so that, after selecting it, the results of a search only include results where that selection applies

## Submission 6 - Comprehensive keyword search against metadata
`As a:` repository user

`I want:` to use keyword searching to search every field in all the records

`So that:` I can find stuff related to the terms I'm searching for

`Done looks like:` A keyword search in a single search box searches all the fields in all the records in the repository

## Submission 7 - Comprehensive keyword search against metadata
`As a:` repository user

`I want:` to see more relevant results for my keyword search

`So that:` I can find things that are more meaningfully related to my search

`Done looks like:` A keyword search more prominently ranks results where my keyword is used more prominently compared to other records
