##Submission 1 - Ability to ingest potentially very large file sizes in one deposit
`As a:`depositor with large discrete files

`I want to:` be able to deposit my files as-is without breaking them up

`So that:` the files maintain their integrity

`Done looks like:` I am easily able to upload large files through a browser interface

`Developer Update:` This requires external storage and would use Fedora 4.
	
##Submission 2 - Ability to ingest potentially very large file sizes
`As a:`depositor with large files

`I want to:` be warned when a process could take a long time

`So that:` I can decide if my planned method of upload is feasible

`Done looks like:` I receive a warning only when I am attempting to deposit something that may take some time

##Submission 3 - Ability to ingest potentially very large file sizes in one deposit
`As a:`depositor with multiple related files, some of which may be large

`I want to:` deposit the files packaged together with information about their relationship (e.g., master data set in native format, a use copy of the same data in an open format, associated metadata files, etc)

`So that:` I can do a one-time deposit of my files packaged together

`Done looks like:` all my files are deposited and represented in one place together
