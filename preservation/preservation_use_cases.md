##Submission 1 - Reporting any mis-matches with original checksums generated at ingest/Validation/checksum mechanisms for objects
`As an:` archivist or collection manager

`I want to:` be notified when any part of a digital object's bitstream changes (from its original checksum)

`So that:` I can ensure the fixity of objects in the digital library by comparing any checksum changes

`Done looks like:` I can choose between automated reports, or reports on demand to learn about checksum changes

##Submission 2 - Reporting any mis-matches with original checksums generated at ingest/Validation/checksum mechanisms for objects
`As an:` archivist

`I want to:` receive checksum reports for deposited objects and submission information packages

`So that:` I can add this information to our accession reports

`Done looks like:` I have ingest information, including checksums, for archives accession documentation

##Submission 3 - Ability to export to dark archive / cloud (bit level)
`As a:` repository manager

`I want to:` export digital objects and their metadata as an archival information package at the bit-level

`So that:` I have an exact bit-level copy of the repository objects

`Done looks like:` I can export bit-level copies of objects and metadata to a dark archive
